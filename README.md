## What is this?
This is a Plate Saw Machine, which cuts straight stripes from a plate. The machine can be controlled via Software automatically, or trough the software/control-panel manually. The cutting-distance of the saw blade and the material feed, too. The thickness of the saw blade will be added automatically in manual-mode.

To control the saw via software in automatic-mode, you can use a code syntax i developed for this machine which will look like that:
```
A50 B300 // Feed Material 50mm and cut into that material 300mm.
A50 B300
A30 B300
A30 B300
A10 B300
ROTATE // Saw stops, user have to rotate the plate 90°, some visual assistance shows user which stripes have to be placed into the machine (not ready yet) and confirms via software/hardware- button.
A100 B100
A100 B100
WAIT // Saw stops, user have to place a new pair of stripes into the machine and confirms to proceed.
A80 B60
A80 B60
WAIT // Saw stops, user have to place a new pair of stripes into the machine and confirms to proceed.
A50 B20
A50 B20
A50 B20
```
The result will look like this:

## About the project
This is a project about building and controlling a Plate Saw Machine. You can generate your own components by using the "ConstructionTemplate.scad"-File with OpenSCAD (http://www.openscad.org). Every component are adjustable in their dimensions as described in the “OpenScadDokumentation”-Folder. In OpenSCAD you also able to switch between the complete overview as the picture below and each single printable part as listened in the “OpenScadDokumentation”-Folder by using the “printmode”-Variable within the “ConstructionTemplate.scad”-File. All details are described in the file itself.

## Necessary experience and software
To get this project to work, you need some experience in printing parts with a 3D-Printer. Also some knowledge in electrical engineering are required, because you have to make a PCB and wire up a power-supply, raspberry-pi and an arduino-mega-2560 + ramps-shield. My files for milling/etching the PCB are to be found in the "KiCad"-Folder. The Files can be edited with the KiCad-Software (http://kicad.org). I used FlatCam (http://flatcam.org) to mill the "Gerber"-Files from KiCad.

## Software used in this project
I use Python to send G-Code-Commands from the Raspberry-Pi to the Arduino over a serial interface. Marlin (http://marlinfw.org) is running on the Arduino and interprets the received G-Code-Commands and drives the engines with the RAMPS1.4 Shield (http://reprap.org/wiki/RAMPS_1.4). My Marlin-Configuration can be found in the "Marlin Firmware"-Folder. 

The Python-Software can be found in the "Python Software"-Folder. At the moment its only available in German. If its necessary, I will rewrite it in english, too. The Software is already able to generate saw-pattern-templates, to cut a plate in different sized plates automatically.

![Config3](https://github.com/VirToReal/VirToCut/blob/master/Images/PythonSoftware_Config_3.png)

But consider, the project is not fully completed yet. Some smaller improvements still has to be made:
- Structure on the material feeder, which prevents the material from rotating. Thought on something like a feather tensioned clamp. 
- Some smaller software updates (don't find the time at the moment). 

  Any help would be appreciated.

Contact me if you want futher informations!
